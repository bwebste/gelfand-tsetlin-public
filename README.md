# gelfand-tsetlin-public
Code used in the paper "Gelfand-Tsetlin modules: canonicity and calculations" and "Gelfand-Tsetlin modules in
  the Coulomb context"

For instructions on using the GAP portion of the code, go to master.gap

Some other calculations, such as calculation of Gelfand-Kirillov dimensions and whether irreps have infinite dimensional weight spaces, we used python code, contained in the analysis subfolder.

For degree computations from "Gelfand-Tsetlin modules in
the Coulomb context" use ComputeDegrees.ipynb, with the backend functions in ComputeDegrees.sage.
